# Individual Project Chatbot App
This the individual assignment submission for Jordan Ribbink.

## APIs Implemented
### Google Places API
https://github.com/slimkrazy/python-google-places

"The Places API is a service that returns information about places using HTTP requests. Places are defined within this API as establishments, geographic locations, or prominent points of interest." - [Google](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/overview)

In my program I use the Place Search which returns a list of places based on a user's location or search string.

This simple python wrapper also implements the Google Geocoding API to convert a qualitative location string to quantitative geographic coordinates.  This step comes prior to the google places search, in order to deliver accurate results.

My implementation uses the Google Places API to query all hospitals in a 20000km radius from the users given location.  It then subsequently chooses the nearest hospital and parses the full address from the API response.  A large part of this functionality is achieved via the wrapper which was used.


### Google Directions API
https://github.com/googlemaps/google-maps-services-python

"The Directions API is a web service that uses an HTTP request to return JSON or XML-formatted directions between locations. You can receive directions for several modes of transportation, such as transit, driving, walking, or cycling." - [Google](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/directions/overview)

The Google Directions API piggy-backs from the address data produced by the Google Places API.  Using the address of the hospital given, the Google Directions API will then produce a series of directions for the most efficient route from the users location to the destination.  I use Google's HTML directions for each step provided in the REST API response and display these one-by-one in the chat.

While the API retains functionality for a wide array of transportation methods, I opt to simply use the driving mode.


**NOTE:** Technically I probably could have done both tasks using the google-maps-services-python library, however it seemed more fitting based on project requirements that I implement two different API wrappers even if one covers both.

### Chatbot "Filters" **NEW TO INDIVIDUAL PROJECT**
A possible quandary whilst exploring the chatbot's source code would arise in the "Filters" present within the Python agent.  These are a higher-order hook whereby the value of data is hooked and modfied recursively by these "filters".

For instance, our query filters iteratively apply their filter function on the user's chatbot query, leading to the final query result.
Initial query: I need to go to the hopital
After spellecheck filter: I need to go to the **hospital**
next filter... modfies the last value and so on

As I alluded, there are 2 different types of filters in the project:

*src/agent/filters/query_filters* - represented by *src/agent/query_filter.py* abstract class which are applied to NN queries before used for prediction
*src/agent/filters/response_filters* - represented by *src/agent/response_filter.py* abstract class which are applied to NN responses after prediction and used to add extra elements (i.e. varied prefixing based on sentiment analysis, total replacement due to arbitrary custom phrase, etc.)

This filter system is fully object-oriented-compliant, as oppose to the half-baked plugin system which previously existed.  It intended to accomplish the same thing as filters, however plugins got hard-coded into the agent class leading to a violation of the encapsulation principle of object-oriented design.  This change probably wasn't necessary for the goals of the project, but it just didn't feel like clean code to me and the project felt *incomplete*.

## Project Repo: 
https://github.com/cosc310-project/chatbot-app/tree/dev

## Project Description and Purpose

Description copied and pasted from the Project Plan:
The project consists of a chatbot built in Electron; the chatbot comes with a generic visual interface to ensure simplicity of use and understanding. (Apparently this is extra credit for the next assignment, which we weren’t aware of until it had been implemented.) The chatbot takes on the role of a doctor, who can be asked questions about different symptoms and describe the likely illness and remedy. Thus, the user takes on the role of a patient.

The purpose of the app is to make a simple diagnostic tool, so that the user can diagnose their possible illnesses without having to leave their home. A doctor will necessarily be a better diagnostic tool than this app, but it's meant to be functional just the same.

## Installation and Usage

### Requirements

- Node JS - https://nodejs.org/en/
- NVM (optional) - https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm
- Python 3 - https://www.python.org/downloads/
- Pyenv (optional) - https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv
- Pyenv-virtualenv (optional) - https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv-virtualenv

Open terminal in the root of the project and run this command:

1.  Install NPM dependencies

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2.  Install Python dependencies

    - OPTIONAL. Install [Pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) & [Pyenv-virtualenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv-virtualenv) to manage Python environment. Follow instructions provided within documentation

      Create a new virutalenv in Python 3.8.10 and activate it

      ```bash
      pyenv virtualenv 3.8.10 ${YOUR_VIRTUALENV_NAME}
      pyenv activate ${YOUR_VIRTUALENV_NAME}
      ```

    - Install requirements via pip by running the following command from the root folder of the project

      ```bash
      pip install -r requirements.txt
      ```

3.  Run this command to train the bot's neural network:

    ```bash
    npm run train
    ```

    If this gives an error, run this instead:

    ```bash
    python util/train.py
    ```

    This may take a bit of time, but after it's run once, it doesn't need to be run again.

4.  Launch development server using the following bash command in root of project

    ```bash
    npm run start
    ```

    The chatbot should launch.

## Vue Components (pseudo classes)

### ChatMessage.vue &lt;ChatMessage&gt;

Props (arguments):

- message -> Message (represents message object containing content/date/sender)

### TypingMessage.vue &lt;TypingMessage&gt;

Props (arguments):

- user -> User (represents user typing)

### ChatBar.vue &lt;ChatBar&gt;

Props (arguments): N/A

### ChatBox.vue &lt;ChatBox&gt;

Props (arguments): N/A

### ChatHeader.vue &lt;ChatHeader&gt;

Props (arguments):

- name -> String (represents name of user in header)

### ChatContainer.vue &lt;ChatContainer&gt;

Props (arguments): N/A

**NOTE:** Prop typings are denoted by [propName] -> [type]. They correspond with native TypeScript types OR typings found in our src/models folder. HTML selectors (class names) are indicated by "[file].vue &lt;[selector]&gt;"

**NOTE**: While vue components are phyiscally represented as classes in code/memory and generally function like so, I don't necessarily know if it is the correct nomenclature. However , based upon the requirements, we can call them this.

Vue technically abides by the MVC (Model-View-Controller structure) where the View is connected two-way data bindding to the Controller (i.e. JS in Vue component). Models are represented as classes in our "src/models" folder

### Message.ts (Message)

Class members:

- date: Date (message date sent)
- sender: User (message sender object)
- message: string (message body)

### Service.ts (_abstract_&nbsp; Service)

Class members:

- protected app: Vue.App (pointer to Vue App instance)

### User.ts (User)

Class members:

# Assignment 3 Project Report

## 30-Turn Feasible Dialogue:

The PDF was consistently corrupted on upload. It can be found under ./documentation/30-Turn_Convo in six parts.

## Features Added:

### TensorFlow:

TensorFlow wasn't listed in the toolkits, but we've included it because we believe that it will more than count as one of the "other toolkits" category named.
It essentially works as a toolkit to implement neural networks into the program.
TensorFlow has improved the AI's ability to recognize sentences, and has been heavily integrated into synonym recognition.

We have no example conversation for TensorFlow, since it's used in training the tool that recognizes the user's input. As such, the best example for it is the 30-turn scenario.

### Spell Checking (Toolkit: Pyspellchecker):

Spell checking isn't counted as a toolkit, but it's an important addition to the bot so we put it here to demonstrate its integration.
The addition of spell check means that if a user doesn't know how to spell a symptom or diagnosis, then as long as it's close to the actual word, the bot will understand

Here's a modified bot output that demonstrates the functionality of spell checking.
![Spelling](/assets/examples/Spell.PNG 'Spell Checking Example')

(The image can be found at ./assets/examples/Spell.PNG if there are any issues.)

### Synonym Recognition - NLTK:

This improves the bot through enabling the user to input synonyms for words, rather than the exact words that the bot has initially listed in its software.
This broadens the bot's recognition of user inputs.

![Synonym Recognition](/assets/examples/Syn.PNG 'Synonym Example')

(The image can be found at ./assets/examples/Syn.PNG if there are any issues.)

### POS Tagging - NLTK:

This isn't used directly in conversation by the bot, but it is used to increase the quality of other features, like synonym recognition.
Essentially, this ensures that synonyms are only considered when they are of the same part of speech.
For example: if "input" is used as a noun in a sentence, synonyms of "input" as a verb will not be included.

Here's a modified bot output that demonstrates the functionality of POS tagging.
![POS](/assets/examples/POS.PNG 'POS Tagging Example')

(The image can be found at ./assets/examples/POS.PNG if there are any issues.)

### Sentiment Analysis - NLTK:

This is the first feature that is directly viewable by the user. When the user inputs a sentence that is particularly negative -- so negative that a human themself could recognize that something is wrong -- the bot will pick up on this and show some sympathy.
This helps the conversation flow a bit more naturally and in a realistic deployment could put a distressed user more at ease, both major improvements

![SentimentAnalysis](/assets/examples/SA.PNG 'Sentiment Example')

(The image can be found at ./assets/examples/SA.PNG if there are any issues.)

### Named Entity Recognition - NLTK:

This is another feature that is viewable by the user. If the user inputs a proper greeting or information about someone else, the bot recognizes this and appends its response accordingly
This helps to make the conversation a bit more personal, and helps it sound less like a programmed entity and more like speaking to a real person

![NE1](/assets/examples/NE.PNG 'Named Entity Recognition Example')

(The image can be found at ./assets/examples/NE.PNG if there are any issues.)

## Data Flow Diagrams

The images and their descriptions can be found at:
chatbot-app\documentation\DFD's.pdf

## Limitations

The bot occasionally fails when the input contains incorrect small words. This is caused by spellcheck, as the number of short words that they could possibly correct to causes the bot not to understand the input properly.

Example:

![Smal](/assets/examples/Short.png 'Small input errors')

(The image can be found at ./assets/examples/Short.PNG if there are any issues.)

The bot also fails when inputs are especially long. This can drag down the bot's performance, as well as raising the likelihood of giving an inaccurate response by a significant amount.

Example:

![large](/assets/examples/Long.png 'Large input errors')

(The image can be found at ./assets/examples/Long.PNG if there are any issues.)

(The images can be found at ./assets/examples/tree.PNG if there are any issues. Alternatively, in the terminal use "gitk --all")

## Possible API Elements

With a bot as complex as ours, there are a number of different functionalities that could be exposed or used to create our own API.

1. Extract the synonyms function (found in util/trainer.py and src/agents/agent.py) to find the synonyms for a specific word, occupying a specific part of speech.
2. Extract spellcheck.py to have a simple spellcheck function using Python's spellcheck library.
3. Extract get_synonymous_sentences (found in src/agents.py) to get sentences that are "one synonym away" from the input sentence.
4. Extract config/dataset.json for a basic map from symptoms to diagnoses to be used in a similar doctor-like or other healthcare-oriented program.
5. Extract the functions to train the neural network (from util/trainer.py) based on all the synonyms for a given word.
